The goal of `invariance` is to help users to perform the first step in Meucci's Checklist: __The Quest for Invariance__.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `invariance` with the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Reckziegel/CMA")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(invariance)
library(tibble)

x <- as_tibble(diff(log(EuStockMarkets)))
x
```

The main statistics of a time-series can be summarized with `series_describe`:

```{r}
series_describe(x)
```

To check if an asset is stationary - "invariant" - use the `plot_ellipsoid` function:

```{r, out.height="80%", out.width="90%"}
# must be univariate
plot_ellipsoid(x[ , 1]) 
```

For "invariant" time-series the shape of the ellipsoid shows a circular format, like in the example above.

To test if a distribution shows any evidence of changing behavior due to passage of time use `ks_test`:

```{r, out.height="80%", out.width="90%"}
ks_test(x[ , 1])
```
